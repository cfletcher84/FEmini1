# **Mini Project: Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project**
*Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project where I showcased my skills using HTML, Flexbox, and CSS! It includes:*
```
:white_check_mark: A Home Page with my welcome message.
:white_check_mark: An About Page where you can learn more things about me.
:white_check_mark: A Resume Page displaying my education, work experience, and skills.
```
*As you explore my portfolio you can enjoy some of the following:*
```
:white_check_mark: A keyframe animation, over my contact information, which smoothly transitions between colors.
:white_check_mark: A cool hover transition on my profile picture where the picture scales to a bigger size.
:white_check_mark: A nice shadow effect on my nav bar.
```
