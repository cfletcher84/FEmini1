            <p>
                
                Hailing from the vibrant islands of Trinidad and Tobago, I've called Texas home for the past 38 years, immersing myself in its culture and opportunities. <br><br> My professional journey has been diverse, spanning across various sales sectors, from the fast-paced world of wireless technology to the dynamic realms of oil and gas, and the intricate landscape of real estate. My academic foundation was laid at the University of Houston, where I pursued a degree in Management Information Systems, a field that ignited my passion for leveraging technology to drive business solutions. <br><br>I find true fulfillment in my role as a devoted family man, cherishing every moment spent with my loved ones above all else.
