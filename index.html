            <p>
                With a diverse journey marked by transitions and growth, I've navigated through various industries to pursue my passion for innovation and problem-solving. Beginning my career in the oil sector, I gained invaluable experience in a dynamic environment, honing my analytical skills and resilience. <br><br> However, it was my eight-year tenure in real estate where I truly flourished, developing a keen understanding of market trends, negotiation tactics, and client relationships. <br><br> Now, embarking on a new chapter, I am embracing my love for technology as I transition into a career as a software engineer. Driven by a desire to create, innovate, and contribute to meaningful projects, I am eagerly diving into the world of coding, ready to leverage my past experiences and embark on a journey of continuous learning and professional fulfillment.
